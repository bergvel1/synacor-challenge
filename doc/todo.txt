TODO

- write debugger with ncurses GUI to step through code

- Figure out teleporter check algorithm
	- idea: overwrite inefficient check loop so that it runs faster
		- First try: set 6027 to be a RET
		- also need r0 == 6 to get past [5465]
		- This works! ...but the code is wrong

Interesting locations:
	[5451]: first "real" check of r7 (outside of initial VM tests)
	[5489]: first call to looping function
		- previously set r0 == 4 and r1 == 1
	[6027]: looping function pt1
	[6035]: looping function pt2
	[6048]: looping function pt3
	[6067]: last return statement? An exit??
